                    <p>I am a huge Star Wars fan. Everyone in my personal circle knows this. </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>While I tend to lean more toward the prequels, I still deeply appreciate the original trilogy. One film stands out above the rest: <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back.</strong></em></p>

                    <br />

                    <p>This movie isn’t just one of the best Star Wars films — it’s one of the greatest films ever made. What sets it apart isn’t just the lightsaber duels or the epic storytelling, but the profound 
                        symbolism and deeper philosophical (and even biblical) undertones woven throughout the narrative.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>I’ll admit that, like many fans, I used to focus mostly on the action — the lightsabers, the heroics, the battles between good and evil. But with time and reflection, I’ve come to see this film 
                        through a new lens — one that reveals something more meaningful. One theme stands out to me: <strong><em className='color'>faith</em></strong>.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>Faith: A Subtle Yet Powerful Thread</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Faith is something inherently human. Whether it’s faith in our work, in others, or in a higher purpose, it often uplifts us and gives life meaning. <strong><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></strong> subtly but powerfully 
                        captures this idea, especially in Luke’s journey to become a Jedi</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>When Obi-Wan tells Luke to travel to Dagobah and seek out Jedi Master Yoda, Luke envisions a powerful, noble warrior who looks like a general ready to lead armies. But when he arrives, he encounters a quirky, small, green 
                        creature who annoys him more than anything. Luke, blinded by expectation and pride, doesn’t realize that the very master he seeks is standing right in front of him.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>This is the same pattern we observe in our lives we often seek solutions to our problems in a logical and obvious manner according to our preconceived notions. We look for answers in grand or obvious places, only to be humbled 
                        when the truth is simple, quiet, or hidden in plain sight. Pride clouds our vision. We become frustrated when the solutions we seek don’t arrive the way we expect. But often, they were right in front of us all along — just not 
                        in the form we imagined.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>Luke’s reaction is deeply human: he complains, grows impatient, and resists. And it’s in this moment that Yoda finally reveals his identity and begins Luke’s training.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>Wisdom Through Stillness</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Yoda instructs Luke to remain calm and passive. One can see much better where they are going when they are not in a rush but rather in peace. Passivity can turn into activity at the right moment.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>He urges Luke to calm his anxious mind, to live in the present moment, and to understand that rushing often leads us astray. <em>“You must unlearn what you have learned,”</em> Yoda says — a line that captures 
                        the very essence of personal growth.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>And how often do we forget this? When our problems overwhelm us, we panic. We lose sight of the lessons we’ve already learned. We perceive our challenges as massive, immovable obstacles — just like Luke does 
                        when he sees his X-Wing sinking into the swamp.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>But our problems are often just reflections of our beliefs. They grow or shrink depending on our perception. When Luke fails to lift the ship and says, “I don’t believe it,” Yoda replies, <em>“That is why you fail.”</em></p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>Faith in Action</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>This moment reminds me of Matthew 8:26, when Jesus calms the storm and rebukes the disciples for their lack of faith: <em className='color'>“Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?”</em>.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>The training scene in Dagobah illustrates perfectly James 1:3- which teaches that trials test our faith, producing perseverance. Yoda isn’t just teaching lightsaber techniques or Force tricks — he’s refining Luke’s <strong>character, 
                    discipline, and inner resolve</strong>. It’s a test of patience, humility, and endurance. Luke struggles with impatience, showing he's not yet "mature and complete."</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>Yoda teaches that the Force responds to belief and intent. When Luke tries to lift the X-Wing and fails, it’s not because it’s too heavy — it’s because he doesn’t <strong className='color'>truly believe</strong> it's possible. Yoda demonstrates that with enough 
                        faith, even the impossible can be achieved. This aligns with the biblical message of belief unlocking divine power as seen in Mark 11:24, <em className='color'>"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."</em></p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong className='color'>Here's How To Apply This Wisdom:</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>1) Identify your ‘X-wing’</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Write down the one thing in your life that feels too heavy or impossible to change — a personal failure, a calling you're afraid to step into, a healing you've stopped praying for, or a dream you’ve shelved.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>2) Take One Step Anyway</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Just like Luke had to try to lift the X-Wing before he could learn what belief really looked like — act even when you feel unqualified or unsure. Apply for the job. Start the project. Get uncomfortable.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>3) Surround Yourself with The Right Crowd</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Yoda didn’t just train Luke in solitude — he spoke truth, challenged him, and modeled belief. Who’s speaking into your life right now? Find people who push you toward faith, not fear. Community cultivates courage.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>4) Reflect on Past Victories</strong></h3>
                    
                    <br />

                    <p>Remember what God has already brought you through. Think of a time when you thought something was impossible — and it wasn’t. God always keeps his promises.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3><strong>5) Let Go of the Outcome</strong></h3>

                    <br />

                    <p>Yoda teaches Luke not just to try, but to trust. You may not control what happens — but you can control what you believe. Even if you are backed down with nothing to show for. Believe that you have victory over it.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p>May this help your journey to become a better person.</p>

                    <br />
                    
                    <p>Blessings,</p>

                    <p>- <em> Andres</em></p>
